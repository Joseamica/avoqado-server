## Architecture Overview

This is a restaurant management platform backend with multi-tenant architecture supporting:

### Core Business Domains

- **Organizations** - Multi-tenant root entities
- **Venues** - Individual restaurant locations
- **Staff Management** - Role-based access control with hierarchical permission system
- **Menu & Product Management** - Menu categories, products, and pricing
- **Order Processing** - Order lifecycle management
- **POS Integration** - Real-time synchronization with Point-of-Sale systems
- **Payment Processing** - Transaction and payment management

### User Role Hierarchy

The system implements a hierarchical role-based access control (RBAC) system with the following roles in descending order of permissions:

#### 1. **SUPERADMIN** (Highest Level)
- **Scope**: Full system access across all organizations and venues
- **Permissions**: Complete administrative control, can access any venue/organization
- **Use Case**: System administrators, platform maintainers
- **Restrictions**: Cannot be invited through normal team invitation flow
- **Special Access**: Maintains SUPERADMIN privileges when switching between venues

#### 2. **OWNER** 
- **Scope**: Full access to all venues within their organization
- **Permissions**: Organization-wide management, can create/manage venues, full staff management
- **Use Case**: Restaurant chain owners, franchise owners
- **Special Access**: Can access any venue within their organization, maintains OWNER privileges across venues
- **Hierarchy**: Can manage all roles except SUPERADMIN

#### 3. **ADMIN**
- **Scope**: Full venue access within assigned venues
- **Permissions**: Complete venue management, staff management, financial reports, system configuration
- **Use Case**: General managers, venue administrators
- **Limitations**: Limited to assigned venues only

#### 4. **MANAGER**
- **Scope**: Operations access within assigned venues
- **Permissions**: Shift management, staff scheduling, operations reports, inventory management
- **Use Case**: Shift managers, assistant managers
- **Focus**: Day-to-day operations and staff coordination

#### 5. **WAITER**
- **Scope**: Service access within assigned venues
- **Permissions**: Order management, table service, basic customer interaction
- **Use Case**: Waitstaff, servers
- **Focus**: Customer service and order processing

#### 6. **CASHIER**
- **Scope**: Payment access within assigned venues
- **Permissions**: Payment processing, basic order management, POS operations
- **Use Case**: Cashiers, front desk staff
- **Focus**: Payment processing and customer checkout

#### 7. **KITCHEN**
- **Scope**: Kitchen display access within assigned venues
- **Permissions**: Kitchen display system, order preparation tracking
- **Use Case**: Kitchen staff, cooks
- **Focus**: Food preparation and kitchen operations

#### 8. **HOST**
- **Scope**: Reservations and seating access within assigned venues
- **Permissions**: Reservation management, seating arrangements, customer greeting
- **Use Case**: Host/hostess, reception staff
- **Focus**: Customer reception and table management

#### 9. **VIEWER** (Lowest Level)
- **Scope**: Read-only access within assigned venues
- **Permissions**: View-only access to reports and data
- **Use Case**: Observers, trainees, external auditors
- **Limitations**: Cannot modify any data or perform operations

#### Permission Inheritance
- **Higher roles inherit permissions from lower roles**
- **SUPERADMIN** has unrestricted access across the entire platform
- **OWNER** has organization-wide access but cannot manage SUPERADMINs
- **Role-based middleware** automatically enforces permissions at the API level
- **Special handling** for cross-venue access based on role hierarchy

### Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.IO for live updates
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ for POS command processing
- **Session Management**: Redis-backed sessions
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens
- **Validation**: Zod schemas
- **Testing**: Jest with comprehensive unit, API, and workflow tests

### Layered Architecture

The codebase follows a clean layered architecture:

```
Routes → Middleware → Controllers → Services → Prisma (Database)
```

- **Routes** (`/src/routes/`) - HTTP endpoint definitions with middleware chains
- **Controllers** (`/src/controllers/`) - HTTP request orchestration (thin layer)
- **Services** (`/src/services/`) - Business logic implementation (core layer)
- **Middlewares** (`/src/middlewares/`) - Cross-cutting concerns (auth, validation, logging)
- **Schemas** (`/src/schemas/`) - Zod validation schemas and TypeScript types

### Key Service Areas

- **Dashboard Services** (`/src/services/dashboard/`) - Admin interface logic
- **TPV Services** (`/src/services/tpv/`) - Point-of-sale terminal operations
- **POS Sync Services** (`/src/services/pos-sync/`) - External POS system integration
- **Communication** (`/src/communication/`) - Socket.IO and RabbitMQ handlers

### Database Schema

Multi-tenant PostgreSQL schema managed by Prisma:

- Organization → Venue hierarchy
- Staff with venue-specific roles
- Product catalog with categories
- Order management with items and payments
- POS synchronization tracking

### Real-time Features

- Socket.IO server for live updates (`/src/communication/sockets/`)
- Room-based broadcasting for venue-specific events
- Business event controllers for order/payment notifications

### Message Processing

- RabbitMQ integration for POS command queuing
- Command listener for database-triggered events
- Retry service for failed command processing
- Event consumer for external POS system events

## Docker Environment

The project includes comprehensive Docker setup:

- Development: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d`
- Production: `docker-compose up -d`
- Database migrations in container: `docker exec avoqado-server-dev npx prisma migrate deploy`

Services:

- **avoqado-server-dev** (port 3000) - Main application
- **avoqado-postgres** (port 5434) - PostgreSQL database
- **avoqado-redis** (port 6379) - Session storage
- **avoqado-rabbitmq** (ports 5672, 15672) - Message broker

## Testing Strategy

Comprehensive test suite organized by type:

- **Unit Tests** (`tests/unit/`) - Service and utility function testing
- **API Tests** (`tests/api-tests/`) - HTTP endpoint integration testing
- **Workflow Tests** (`tests/workflows/`) - End-to-end business process testing

Test configuration includes coverage thresholds (70% global, 80% for critical services) and project-based Jest setup for parallel execution.

## UI Design Guidelines

### Color System (shadcn/ui)

When working with the dashboard/web interface, always use **shadcn/ui semantic color tokens** instead of hardcoded colors. This ensures proper theming support and consistency across the application.

#### Semantic Color Usage:

**Backgrounds:**
- `bg-background` - Main background color  
- `bg-muted` - Subtle background for secondary elements
- `bg-card` - Card/surface background
- `bg-accent` - Accent background for hover states
- `bg-primary` - Primary brand color background
- `bg-secondary` - Secondary background
- `bg-destructive` - Error/danger states

**Text Colors:**
- `text-foreground` - Primary text color
- `text-muted-foreground` - Secondary/subtle text
- `text-primary` - Primary brand color text
- `text-secondary` - Secondary text color
- `text-destructive` - Error/danger text

**Borders:**
- `border-border` - Default border color
- `border-input` - Form input borders
- `border-primary` - Primary brand color borders
- `border-destructive` - Error state borders

#### Status-Specific Colors:

**Success/Online States:**
- `bg-green-500/10 text-green-700 dark:text-green-400` for success backgrounds
- `text-green-600` for success text

**Warning/Maintenance States:**  
- `bg-orange-500/10 text-orange-700 dark:text-orange-400` for warning backgrounds
- `text-orange-600` for warning text
- `bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900/30 dark:text-orange-400` for maintenance mode

**Error/Offline States:**
- `bg-destructive/10 text-destructive` for error backgrounds
- Use `text-destructive` for error text

#### Important Rules:
1. **Never use hardcoded colors** like `bg-gray-50`, `text-blue-500`, etc.
2. **Always use semantic tokens** that respect dark/light theme modes
3. **Use opacity modifiers** (e.g., `/10`, `/20`) for subtle background effects
4. **Provide dark mode alternatives** when using custom colors
5. **Maintain consistency** across all UI components

## Database Schema Documentation

The complete database schema is documented in `/docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`. This file contains:

- **Comprehensive model explanations** with purpose and use cases
- **Relationship documentation** showing how models connect
- **Business logic examples** for each entity
- **Schema evolution guidelines** for future changes

### Schema Maintenance Rules:

**CRITICAL**: When modifying `prisma/schema.prisma`, you MUST also update:
1. `/docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` - Add/update model documentation
2. `CLAUDE.md` - Document the changes made
3. Seed data in `prisma/seed.ts` if new models added
4. Related API documentation

The schema documentation serves as context for AI assistants and team members, so accuracy is essential.

## Development Notes
